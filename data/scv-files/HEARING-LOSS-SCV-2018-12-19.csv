The allele frequency of the p.Tyr3747X variant in the Ush2A gene is 0.017% (4/24020) of African chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org), which is a low enough frequency to award PM2_Supporting based on the thresholds defined by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Expert Panel for autosomal recessive hearing loss ( PM2_Supporting). This variant has been detected in 1 patient with hearing loss in trans with a suspected pathogenic variant (PM3_Supporting, Partners LMM internal data SCV000713838.1).
