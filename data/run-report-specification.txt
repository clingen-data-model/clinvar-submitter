Some of the Processing Exceptions immediately below may be able to be validated using the CLI validation logic.

+++ Processing Exceptions (these can be thrown to system.out/console since they may involve the inability to create the report file.
1.	if output files exist and no force overwrite is specified
ERROR 101 – output or report file exists! (use –f Force overwrite to overwrite these files).
2.	If input or context (if specified) file doesn’t exist or could not be read 
ERROR 102 – input or context file not found.
ERROR 103 – input or context file could not be read. (locked?)
3.	If directory is specified and no *.json files exist
ERROR 105 – no JSON files found for processing in <directory>. Only files with the extension *.json will be processed when specifying an input directory.

(If all the above passes without error then the assumption is that the Run Report file can be created – see below for exceptions and output formatting)

--- v1.0 Remaining Work ---
- Finalize/Test Run Report with all Exceptions
- Command line arguments all work as expected
-- need to capture constant values for: AssertionMethod and AssertionMethodCitation from user and input as args
-- 
- Document SOP for ClinGen users to request/receive clinvar submissions (request, email instructs, etc.)
-- add notes in email response to user that include the following sentiments:
--- All genomic coordinates are mapped to genome build 38
--- Please provide feedback from your experience so that we can improve the future drafting of clinvar submissions
--- you will need to review columns AW, AX, & AK (collection method, allele origin & affected status) are required but not available from interpretation message. Please fill in before submitting.
- Directory of json files as input  (if possible, but not mandatory)
- Test run and sign off by ClinGen user representatives.

--- RELEASE NOTES ---
Not supported in this release
0.  No mapping to ClinVar supported disease codes.
1.	Phenotypes in Condition.
2.	Always specifies variant genomic coordinates mapped to Build GRCh38.
3.	Does not fill in condition-name unless explicitly specified in condition.name field, not from disease-coding.display
4.	Does not handle multiple codings in condition.disease.
5.	No validation of terms used for criteria rules or strength. 
6.	Assumes a two-term space separated value for strength.
7.	No sorting of summarized met strength codes.
8.  No support for multiple file or directory input.
9.  Some fallout from ClinVar id to Allele Registry due to synchronization timing. (and some exceptional situations - see A/R release notes)
