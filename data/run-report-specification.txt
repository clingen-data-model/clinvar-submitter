Some of the Processing Exceptions immediately below may be able to be validated using the CLI validation logic.

+++ Processing Exceptions (these can be thrown to system.out/console since they may involve the inability to create the report file.
1.	if output files exist and no force overwrite is specified
ERROR 101 – output or report file exists! (use –f Force overwrite to overwrite these files).
2.	If input or context (if specified) file doesn’t exist or could not be read 
ERROR 102 – input or context file not found.
ERROR 103 – input or context file could not be read. (locked?)
3.	If directory is specified and no *.json files exist
ERROR 105 – no JSON files found for processing in <directory>. Only files with the extension *.json will be processed when specifying an input directory.

(If all the above passes without error then the assumption is that the Run Report file can be created – see below for exceptions and output formatting)
