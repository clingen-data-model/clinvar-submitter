This directory represents the 'clinvarscv' cloud function and related service. The way that this is built and deployed is by making a modification to any of the code files in this directory and pushing them to master. This will in turn, cause the 'clinvar-scv-gcp-function-push' cloud build trigger on the 'clingen-stage' platform to invoke the cloudbuild.yaml file to build and deply the google cloud function container.
