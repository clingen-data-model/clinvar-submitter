## ClinVar Submission Template Generation
This is a mapping of the ClinGen-SEPIO VarPathInterp model to the ClinVar Submission Template fields generated by this tool. This version of the tool is taking a minimalist approach in providing the necessary fields to achieve a viable submission to ClinVar. With few exceptions.

Only the Variant Sheet within the ClinVar Submission Template is mapped since that sheet represents a submission record per row.

Here is the Column list mapping the Excel column+ClinVar header with the json path expression to the element that would map. Additional notes are provided to describe how correct elements are aggregated or collected to fulfill the mapping requirement.

## Variant Sheet Column/Heading Mapping
Shortcut notations for mapping.

- **Interp** is used for the root level VariantPathogenicityInterpretation record.
- **CanonicalVariant** represents the **Interp**.canonicalAllele or the interpretations variant in canonical form.  See the section on Variants below the mapping table for more details on how these data are mapped.
- **ContextualVariant** represents the preferred contextual allele within the **Interp**s canonicalAllele. It is needed in order to fulfill the submission as ClinVar does not accept CanonicalVariant ids at this juncture.
- **Condition** is presumed to be the 'singular' condition for the **Interp**s Variant-Condition mapping. Not all **Interp**s have a Condition (eg. ben, lik ben, vus). see section on Conditions below the mapping table for more details on how these data are mapped.


| Column    | Field  | Mapping Notes      |
| --------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| ##Local ID (A) | Interp.id | This will contain the VCI's internal identifier for the specific variant interpretation record.|
| Reference sequence (D) |  ContextualVariant.referenceCoordinate.reference.label | An E-204 exception is raised if no ContextualVariant.referenceCoordinate.reference element is found. If no label is found a blank value is produced.  |
| Start (G) | ContextualVariant.referenceCoordinate.start.index | convert from 0-based to 1-based hgvs form. The E-205 exception is raised if the *.start.index element is not found. |
| Stop (H) | ContextualVariant.referenceCoordinate.stop.index | convert from 0-based to 1-based hgvs form. The E-206 exception is raised if the *.stop.index element is not found. |
| Reference allele (I) | ContextualVariant.referenceCoordinate.refState | The E-207 exception is raised if the element is not found. |
| Alternate allele (J) | ContextualVariant.state | The E-205 exception is raised if the element is not found. |
| Variant identifiers (X) | CanonicalVariant.id | The E-202 exception is raised if the element is not found. |
| Alternate designations (Z) | CanonicalVariant.relatedIdentifier.label OR ContextualVariant.alleleName.name[nameType='hgvs'] | Prioritize the CanonicalVariant.relatedIdentifier.label that starts with a transcript (NM_*). If not found then defer to the preferred allele name with 'hgvs' as the 'name type'. If neither exists then raise the E-203 exception. |
| Condition ID type (AD) | blank OR Condition.disease[0].id[type] | see section on Condition for more details. Assumes **Condition**.disease[0].id exists and has the format <type>:<value>.|
| Condition ID value (AE) | (blank OR Condition.disease[0].id[value] | see section on Condition for more details. Assumes **Condition**.disease[0].id exists and has the format <type>:<value>. |
| Preferred condition name (AF) | Forced to "Not Specified" OR Condition.disease[0] OR Condition.disease[0].label | The condition rules are more complex. See section below table for more details on this mapping and transformation. |
| Clinical significance (AK) | Interp.statementOutcome.label | if the Interp.statementOutcome is not found an E-402 exception will be raised. If the statementOutcome.label is not provided, a blank value will be used. |
| Date last evaluated (AL) | Interp.contribution.contributionDate | if the Interp.contribution.contributionDate does not found an E-403 exception will be raised. The final format will be yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSXXX if no time portion is available then just the yyyy-MM-dd will be produced. |
| Assertion method (AM) | <assertion method provided by caller> | Not pulled from the Interp record since it is unavailable, a value can be specified but the default will be "ACMG Guidelines, 2015".  |
| Assertion method citation (AN) | <method citation provided by caller> | Like the Assertion method the method citation is not available, so a value can be specified for all records, it defaults to "PMID:25741868". |
| Mode of inheritance (AO) | (get condition :moi) | |
| Clinical significance citations (AP) | (get evidence :pmid-citations) | |
| Comment on clinical significance (AR) | (get evidence :summary) | |
