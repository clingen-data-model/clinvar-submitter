Open Questions... as of 15.Dec.2018 LBabb
(CAR) are the coordinates left-shifted?
(ClinVar) don't they "normalize" coordinates if they are left-shifted?
(SEPIO) approver => affiliation (if available) user (otherwise)
(SEPIO) contributor(s) => any user and/or affiliation specifically selected as "contributor" (only in GCI thus far).
(VCI) when will the GCI's contributor selection list be available in VCI?
(SEPIO) The rule for approver datetime is to use the "approval reviewed date


NOTES about VCI json
====================
root (interpretation)
  schema_version        (X schema version 6 of interp - not needed - internal for VCI? could be useful for provenance possibly?)
  @id                   (vci iri/identifier/guid with /interpretations/<uuid> prefix)
  uuid                  (the guid of the @id above - use this to create an iri or parse the @id?)
  status                (X not needed - in progress | ? | ? | ... )
  date_created          (X not needed)
  last_modified         (X not needed at this point - UTC DT format)
  modified_by           (X not needed - last modified by - could be different than submitted_by I guess - ask VCI for diff)
  submitted_by          (this is the backup "approver")
  affiliation           (this is the "approver" by default if not then submitter)
  audit                 (X unused or not needed)
  ---

  interpretation_disease (@id of disease /diseases/<disease.uuid>)
  disease
  interpretation_status (X not needed - Provisional | ? | ? | ... )
  modeInheritance       (MOI - need to deal with MOIAdjective)

    interpretation_associated[]
    alteredClassification_present   (always exists but blank if same as autoClassification)
    alteredClassification           (seems to be a dupe of above- only exists if above is not blank)
    reason_present                  (if altered then this is the "reason" for the alteration - it will be blank if no alteration occurs)
    reason                          (seems to be a dupe of above- only exists if above is not blank)
    classificationStatus            (** RULE: should always be "Approved")
    classificationApprover          (individual user name /no id/ that approved - i believe this is the selected one by the actual user)
    autoClassification              (calculated classification)
    approvalSubmitter               (this is the user /name/ that saved the approval - the classificationApprover is the selected approver if provided)
    approvalDate                    (this appears to be the same as the approvalReviewDate)
    approvalReviewDate              (the selected approval date - can be backdated and may not match actual snapshot record dates)
    approvedClassification          (equal to autoClassification unless alteredClassification exists)

    provisionalDate
    provisionedClassification
    provisionalReviewDate
    provisionalSubmitter
    publishClassification           (boolean t/f -> always false - not clear if this is implemented yet)
    associatedInterpretationSnapshots[]   (the approvalStatus = "approved" is the one that is the actual date/time it was last approved - application timestamps of saved provisional or approval records)
      uuid
      date_created         (date time of this snapshot record)
      resourceId           (interp.uuid)

    lab                  (? always "/labs/curator/" ?)

  VERIFY with VCI which use cases exist for the diseases (MONDO id, phenotypes or text?)
  disease (single map item - analogous to genetic condition)
    schema_version        (X schema version of disease - not needed - internal we think)
    @id                   (iri of disease - same as /interpretation_disease - "/diseases/<disease.uuid>")
    uuid                  (vci disease uuid - equal to Genetic condition concept id)
    status                (X not needed - internal - status of disease?)
    date_created          (X not needed - is this the date the disease was created overall or in the context of this interp? - odd)
    last_modified         (X ? the last date/time the disease was modified ?)
    modified_by           (X not needed - user that changed the disease last ?)
    submitted_by          (X not needed - user that submitted the disease? - what does it mean to "submit the disease" - ask VCI)
    ---
    diseaseId             (MONDO id MONDO_99999999 format)

    description           (description of disease)
    synonyms[]            (X alt labels for disease - not needed - maybe we should?)
    associatedInterpretations[]   (X not needed - list of interpretation ids from all of VCI linked to this disease - odd?)
    associatedFamilies[]  (X not needed - seems like there's a "families" model for all the families in VCI that relate to this disease - all iris in format /families/<family.uuid>)
    associatedIndividuals[] (X not needed - seems like there's an "individuals" model for all the individuals in VCI that relate to this disease - all iris in format /individuals/<individual.uuid>)
    associatedGdm[]       (X not needed - seems like there's a "gdm" model for all the GDMs? in VCI that relate to this disease - all iris in format /gdm/<gdm.uuid>)
    associatedGroups[]    (X not needed - not used?)

  evaluations[] (evaluation<<item>>) (criterion assessments - one per rule)
    (groups of criterion get copies of the same evidence, pmids, explanations, submitted_by, modified_by, dates)
    HERE ARE the groups
      group1: (population) BA1, PM2, BS1
      group2: (computational) PP3, BP4, BP1, PP2
      group3: (no evidence) PVS1
      group4: (no evidence) BP2
      group5: (no evidence) PM3
      group6: (no evidence) BS3, PS3

    @id
    uuid                  (the uuid of the evaluation @id = /evaluations/<eval.uuid>)
    status                (X not needed - i think this is a super class thing on all versioned schema concepts)
    date_created
    last_modified
    modified_by
    submitted_by
    affiliation           (? why is this on evaluations since they are part of interpretations - when would it ever differ)
    variant
    ---
    criteria              (criterion code (BA1, BS1, PM2, etc..)
    criteriaModifier      (the modifier for the strength (strong->moderate, etc)
    modifier              (? not sure what this is - seems to be redundant with criteriaModifier)
    criteriaStatus        (met | not-met | not-evaluated)
    interpretation_associated[] (X not needed - list of all interps this evaluation is related to - should alwasy be one item - it is!)
    explanation           (this is the text the users enter on the group of criterion)
    evidence_type         (this dictates the "evidence concept" for this evaluation - eg. Population)
